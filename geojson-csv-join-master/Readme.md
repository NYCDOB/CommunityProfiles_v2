# geojson-csv-join

A script to take a GeoJSON file, and JOIN data onto that file from a CSV file.

## Running

### Prereq:

	- First make sure your GeoJSON file is in the working directory called `in.geojson` (an example is included in the repo)
	- Then make sure your CSV file is in the working directory called `in.csv` (an example is included in the repo)
	- Then open `index.js`, and change the "SETTINGS" area for the column names that you wish to join.
	- Finally, in a command prompt, run:

	$ npm install
	$ node index.js
