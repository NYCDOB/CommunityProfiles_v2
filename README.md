## DOB Community Profiles

The Department of Buildings’ (DOB) Community Profiles application provides an easy way for New Yorkers to quickly see the construction activity in their Community District, and to get an idea of how that compares to the rest of the city. Select a metric from the main menu, and you’ll see a shaded choropleth map showing the areas of highest and lowest activity for that metric across the five boroughs. On the right side of the screen, you’ll see that metric broken down further to show total distribution across the boroughs or to highlight the 10 highest activity Community Districts.
